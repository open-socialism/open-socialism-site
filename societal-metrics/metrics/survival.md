To what degree is the society ensuring the people's survival. Note the society should not be purely focused on ensuring the societies survival in it's current form because adaption and restructure can be beneficial.

Questions can be:

* Is long term survival being harmed by any present day actions? eg. environmental damage
* Are there long term plans for human survival? eg. how to transisition from fossil fuels
