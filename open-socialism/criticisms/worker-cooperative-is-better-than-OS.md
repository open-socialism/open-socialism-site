title: 'Worker Cooperative is Better Than OS'
---

'[Worker cooperatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperative){:target="_blank"} are the sweet spot. They combine good parts of capitalism such as incentive to work, but employees are not exploited as they democratically control the company'.

Worker cooperatives are an interesting and have proven to be successful, at least in [some cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation){:target="_blank"}. This is quite suprising given they are competing and against non-worker cooperatives which in theory should be more efficient as they are comfortable exploiting their workers to be more competitive.

Worker cooperatives are defintely an improvement over DC as they counter wealth inequality, exploitation of workers and unethical lobbying (since workers as a group are unlikely to vote for unethical practices).

However, they are more in the vein of evolutionary improvements to DC. When compared to OS they are not as efficient as you still have multiple companies expending resources competing against each other, reinventing the wheel, legal battles etc.

Good step for DC? Defintely. Competitive with brand new systems like OS, no.
