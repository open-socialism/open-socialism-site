Open Socialism has the following goals in order of importance.

1. Ensure the long term survival of the human species.
    * Live sustainably on planet Earth.
    * Colonize other planets so that humans cannot be wiped out if Earth becomes uninhabitable for whatever reason.
2. Have a society that is sustainable for the people who live in it. People should be happy, needed, productive but not overworked. Without a happy populace the system is not sustainable and will destablize.
3. Scientific and technological advancement.

The orders of the goals only comes into play when a lower priority goal must be sacrificed. For example if a meteroite will impact with eart all endeavours would be focused on dealing with that situation and individual happiness would temporarily not be a focus.

Otherwise the regular work of society would infact be scientific and technological advancement as this under pins long term survival and the sustainability of society.
