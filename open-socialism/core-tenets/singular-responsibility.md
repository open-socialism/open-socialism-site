title: 'Singular Responsibility'

Individuals and companies need to be jack of all trades most of the time. A clothes manufacturer needs a HR department which is not their expertise. Instead it is better if a singular department of society is concerned with HR and then other sections of society can utilize them as efficiently as possible.

Generally this principle can be applied at any level of society. Individuals and groups work better if they have very specific tasks and challenges. With technology very specific committees and teams and can be set up for highly specific problems.
