Try to shoot down any ideas or proposals. Always look for counter arguments. This is most important with OS itself. Without constant criticism a system can become self perpetuating despite better alternatives. OS should always be ready to pack up shop and make room for a better system (or more realistically incorporate the good parts of the new system and become even stronger).
