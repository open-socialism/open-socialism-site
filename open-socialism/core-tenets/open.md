Open describes 2 core mechanisms within Open Socialism.

## All information is easily accessible

All forms of discussion and deliberation at any level of society should be easily accessible, both in real time and historical. There would be some exceptions relating to privacy or extremely sensitive information but these cases should be less than 1% of all information available.

## Anyone can contribute to matters that they care about

There are mechanisms in place for people to make suggestions/comments/questions about any decision within society. A filtration/consolidation system would be used in the case where there are a large number of people giving feedback. People should also be able to directly contribute to pieces of work within society by suggesting changes.

There are flow on effects of these open principles.

* Corruption becomes very difficult since decision making is always conducted in the open.
* People not directly charged with a matter can still follow it and contribute. This empowers people to influence society for issues that they care about.
* Public involvement acts as a check and balance for decisions. A select group of people making a decision, even if they are specialists, can in some cases get swayed by bias or emotion. With public involvement such cases should result in the public flagging the issue and it being reconsidered.
* The public is empowered to directly contribute to areas of society that they care about. This provides feelings of control and should be satisfying.
