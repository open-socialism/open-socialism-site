title: 'Inheritance'

Inheritance can be dangerous because it can allow unfair accumulation of wealth. At the same time, as people can't amass large quantities of wealth through private enterprise how much of an issue is it? If one's parents were very frugal and saved a decent amount of wealth is it fair for their child to have an advantage compared to another child?

I would not start with having restrictions here. Since everyone should have an abundance inheritance isn't terribly unfair. Perhaps at a certain point (if multiple generations accumulate credits) a limit could be set that rest donated to some cause? At the same time, since everyone has an abundance inheritance isn't even that necessary.
