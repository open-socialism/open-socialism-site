All goods including essential goods such as clothing and food will not be free and will need to be bought with income. People will have an abundance of income and will be able to afford all the essentials even if they are not working and receive the lowest possible income.

The reason essential goods are not free is because if they were free people may wastefully use them. It also gives people the option of heavily prioritizing the use of their money into certain areas if they wish. So someone could not get new clothes as often to save money for example.

Non essential goods will also cost money and range from upper market versions of essential goods and purely non-essential items such as a soccer ball.
