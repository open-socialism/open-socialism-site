A project has a specific goal which may be completable or ongoing. It consists of a team of people which may include circle members.

A project ultimately reports to a circle. Exactly how the distribution of management between the project team and the circle will depend on the circumstances but typically a project will be self managed in terms of day to day but report to a circle for bigger decisions.
