title: 'Employment'
---

DC itself is actually pretty good with providing employment to people. Unemployment rates typically sit at around 5%.

The issue with employment more so comes from globalization and the fact that menial work can be done in poor countries for a much lower wage. Since corporations care about profits above providing jobs to people locally wealthy DC countries have a decreasing local workforce. The internet is also adding to this effect as collaboration with workers in different countries increasingly becomes easier.

## The Result

There aren't many barriers to employment under DC but globalization can cause problems when a DC society sits in a global economy.
