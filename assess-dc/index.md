DC is a system that can create a great amount of wealth but unfortunately the majority of that wealth goes to a select number of wealthy people in society. This generation of wealth is not concerned with the greater good or long term thinking and thus society doesn't head towards more happiness and success. The only thing that DC is reasonable at is motivating people to strive since they can be greatly rewarded but they are not motivated to strive for the good of society which would be ideal.

Ultimately DC boils down to a class based system similar to those seen in feudalism with a ruling class, a middle class and a working class, with each group having different rights to health, education and the wealth of their labor. This is only mitigated due to the incredible level of technology that has been reached and DC countries exploiting cheap labor in poor countries, which means that even the working class in DC can be relatively well off. However, the ruling class are still staggeringly more wealthy and the wealth inequality is constantly increasing.

The ruling wealthy class also has tremendous political power through the lobbying system which allows them to affect policy which enables them to become more rich which gives them more political power and so on.

DC also requires continual expansion of the economy which mitigates the problem of those with existing wealth being too wealthy as there is lots of new wealth being created and distributed through income and taxation. However, perpetual expansion is not possible which is why there is the continual boom bust cycle which ultimately continues to reward the already wealthy with a greater proportion of all wealth.

DC is a 300 year old answer to feudalism and it is a better system. Unfortunately it comes with it's own set of problems and doesn't work well to provide value to the vast majority of society.
